Johnny + Gina Project

## Fixes that need to be made currently
1. Separate code from big file into multiple files
2. Fix timezone handling with Back4app, only stores UTC times so need to figure out how to standardize it to EST
3. Need to add countdown to each added event so we can see how far time is from event to event, maybe add a difference between events as well so we can see how long we will be apart. 

### Features that we want to add in the future
